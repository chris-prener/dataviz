[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" With the release of the 2013-2017 5-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau\u0026rsquo;s American Community Survey, I wanted to get a sense of how St. Louis\u0026rsquo;s neighborhoods are changing in terms of population. These percentages compare the latest population estimates to the 2010 Decennial Census.\nThe largest estimated population growth is found in Downtown, Downtown West, the Central West End, The Grove, Lafayette Square, and Tower Grove East. Much of the rest of Midtown and South City saw either modest population increases or were stable. North City, with the exception of Old North and the West End, saw varying degrees to population loss.\n\nTechnical Notes This map was created by interpolating census tract data into neighborhood boundaries for both the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2013-2017 ACS. Population change was then calculated and mapped using a modification of Jenks natural breaks.\nACS data should be interpreted as estimates and not exact population values, and are therefore subject to a degree of error. Interpolation introduces a degree of error as well, particularly in neighborhoods boarding significant un-populated areas like Forest Park or the Botanical Gardens.\nAll data analysis and mapping was done using R, using the tidycensus package for data access, the areal package for interpolations, and ggplot2 for mapping.\n","date":1544335200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544335200,"objectID":"3cfe956ee975967597eca4cf2e1bdb62","permalink":"/dataviz/project/stl-pop-change/","publishdate":"2018-12-09T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/dataviz/project/stl-pop-change/","section":"project","summary":"Population changes, 2010 to 2017.","tags":["StLouis","GIS","Demography"],"title":"St. Louis Neighborhood Change","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" When Chief Belmar\u0026rsquo;s proposal for consolidating the City and County police departments was released to the media, one page happened to catch my eye. It had two kernal density maps of Part 1 crimes, which are defined by the FBI as all violent crimes (aggravated assault, rape, murder, and robbery) as well as property crimes (arson, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft).\nAs you can see, the map quality was poor and it lacked a legend (or even a description of what Part 1 crimes are). It also leaves viewers with the strong impression that crime is focused on Downtown. This supports the report\u0026rsquo;s argument that policing resources need to be focused on two areas, Downtown and the Central West End. The report makes no mention of the hotspot in South City. The map was also focusedon the city\u0026rsquo;s midsection, cutting off both North and South City.\nRecreating the Density Maps As an exercise in using some new mapping software, I decided to recreate these maps. First up with my attempt to recreate the original map in the Belmar report.\nThe map is not fundamentally different, though I would argue it is easier to read and provides more context (i.e. a legend and clear breaks between the different colors on the map). We still see noticiable clusters over Downtown and in South City.\nI do think, however, the select of Part 1 Crimes was done for a specific reason. If you map violent crime (aggravated assault, rape, murder, and robbery), the conclusion you would come to about Downtown is slightly different.\nIn terms of violent crime, the Downtown area of St. Louis no longer makes a significant impression relative to the rest of North City. To be sure, violent crime remains a concern in Downtown St. Louis, it just isn\u0026rsquo;t as remarkable.\nCrime is (in Part) a Function of Population Density Another thing wholly absent from the Belmar Proposal is that crime is, in part, influenced by population density. We expect more crime to exist in areas where there are more people. We can see this pretty clearly in St. Louis for both part 1 and violent crimes:\nGiven this relationship, it is important to look at crime rates as opposed to the volume of crime in a given area.\nMapping Crime Rates in St. Louis To get a sense about whether crime appears high in Downtown St. Louis because it is one of the more densly populated areas of the city, I\u0026rsquo;ve mapped Part 1 crime rates per 1,000 individuals. To get there, I divide the total number of crimes by the total number of esimtated people living in each neighborhood, and then multiply by 1,000.\nOnce we factor in population density, we see that while Downtown remains a significant focal point for crime, there are areas both north and south of Downtown (as well as north of Forest Park) that also have high crime rates, but are not emphasized on the Belmar Proposal map.\nWhen we look only at violent crimes, the argument for focusing on Downtown goes away - our attention is drawn to North City as the locus for much of the violent crime in St. Louis.\nBottom Line The hotspot that the Belmar proposal highlights is due to property crimes like larcency and motor vehicle theft, rather than violent crimes. At no point is there a significant volumne of crime in the Central West End, which was the other neighborhood highlighted in Belmar\u0026rsquo;s proposal. In fact, a good argument could be made that policing resources are most needed in the areas of the city no emphasized in the report at all.\n","date":1544335200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544335200,"objectID":"6d594dd3bb8a8035ade28d73e23d78cc","permalink":"/dataviz/project/stl-belmar-crime/","publishdate":"2018-12-09T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/dataviz/project/stl-belmar-crime/","section":"project","summary":"Replicating a map from the Belmar Plan.","tags":["StLouis","GIS","Crime"],"title":"Violent Crime in St. Louis","type":"project"}]
