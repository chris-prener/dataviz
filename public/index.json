[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" With the release of the 2013-2017 5-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau\u0026rsquo;s American Community Survey, I wanted to get a sense of how St. Louis\u0026rsquo;s neighborhoods are changing in terms of population. These percentages compare the latest population estimates to the 2010 Decennial Census.\nThe largest estimated population growth is found in Downtown, Downtown West, the Central West End, The Grove, Lafayette Square, and Tower Grove East. Much of the rest of Midtown and South City saw either modest population increases or were stable. North City, with the exception of Old North and the West End, saw varying degrees to population loss.\n\nTechnical Notes This map was created by interpolating census tract data into neighborhood boundaries for both the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2013-2017 ACS. Population change was then calculated and mapped using a modification of Jenks natural breaks.\nACS data should be interpreted as estimates and not exact population values, and are therefore subject to a degree of error. Interpolation introduces a degree of error as well, particularly in neighborhoods boarding significant un-populated areas like Forest Park or the Botanical Gardens.\nAll data analysis and mapping was done using R, using the tidycensus package for data access, the areal package for interpolations, and ggplot2 for mapping.\n","date":1544335200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544335200,"objectID":"3cfe956ee975967597eca4cf2e1bdb62","permalink":"/project/stl-pop-change/","publishdate":"2018-12-09T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/stl-pop-change/","section":"project","summary":"Population changes, 2010 to 2017.","tags":["StLouis","GIS","Demography"],"title":"St. Louis Neighborhood Change","type":"project"}]
