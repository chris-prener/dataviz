It had two kernel density maps of Part 1 crimes, which are defined by the FBI as all violent crimes (aggravated assault, rape, murder, and robbery) as well as property crimes (arson, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft).
As you can see, the map quality was poor and it lacked a legend (or even a description of what Part 1 crimes are).</description>
