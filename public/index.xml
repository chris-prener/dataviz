      <title>St. Louis Neighborhood Change</title>

&lt;p&gt;With the release of the 2013-2017 5-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;American Community Survey&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to get a sense of how St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s neighborhoods are changing in terms of population. These percentages compare the latest population estimates to the 2010 Decennial Census.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest estimated population growth is found in Downtown, Downtown West, the Central West End, The Grove, Lafayette Square, and Tower Grove East. Much of the rest of Midtown and South City saw either modest population increases or were stable. North City, with the exception of Old North and the West End, saw varying degrees to population loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/dataviz/project/stl-pop-change/nhoodChange.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/dataviz/project/stl-pop-change/nhoodChange.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technical-notes&#34;&gt;Technical Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This map was created by interpolating census tract data into neighborhood boundaries for both the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2013-2017 ACS. Population change was then calculated and mapped using a modification of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jenks natural breaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACS data should be interpreted as &lt;em&gt;estimates&lt;/em&gt; and not exact population values, and are therefore subject to a degree of error. Interpolation introduces a degree of error as well, particularly in neighborhoods boarding significant un-populated areas like Forest Park or the Botanical Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data analysis and mapping was done using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidycensus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package for data access, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slu-openGIS/areal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;areal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package for interpolations, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Violent Crime in St. Louis</title>

&lt;p&gt;When Chief Belmar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/42/8423788c-c647-54dc-89c9-db985e6e77ce/5c3028f56c8fe.pdf.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; for consolidating the City and County police departments was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-county-police-chief-proposes-merger-with-st-louis/article_d3ffb36f-fa7f-553b-93f4-ea6c6f0203af.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;released to the media&lt;/a&gt;, one page happened to catch my eye. It had two kernal density maps of Part 1 crimes, which are defined by the FBI as all violent crimes (aggravated assault, rape, murder, and robbery) as well as property crimes (arson, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;belmarMap.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the map quality was poor and it lacked a legend (or even a description of what Part 1 crimes are). It also leaves viewers with the strong impression that crime is focused on Downtown. This supports the report&amp;rsquo;s argument that policing resources need to be focused on two areas, Downtown and the Central West End. The report makes no mention of the hotspot in South City. The map was also focusedon the city&amp;rsquo;s midsection, cutting off both North and South City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recreating-the-density-maps&#34;&gt;Recreating the Density Maps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an exercise in using some new mapping software, I decided to recreate these maps. First up with my attempt to recreate the original map in the Belmar report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;density_map_p1_cropped.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map is not fundamentally different, though I would argue it is easier to read and provides more context (i.e. a legend and clear breaks between the different colors on the map). We still see noticiable clusters over Downtown and in South City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think, however, the select of Part 1 Crimes was done for a specific reason. If you map violent crime (aggravated assault, rape, murder, and robbery), the conclusion you would come to about Downtown is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;density_map_v_cropped.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of violent crime, the Downtown area of St. Louis no longer makes a significant impression relative to the rest of North City. To be sure, violent crime remains a concern in Downtown St. Louis, it just isn&amp;rsquo;t as remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crime-is-in-part-a-function-of-population-density&#34;&gt;Crime is (in Part) a Function of Population Density&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing wholly absent from the Belmar Proposal is that crime is, in part, influenced by population density. We expect more crime to exist in areas where there are more people. We can see this pretty clearly in St. Louis for both part 1 and violent crimes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pop_plot_p1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pop_plot_v.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this relationship, it is important to look at crime &lt;em&gt;rates&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to the volume of crime in a given area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mapping-crime-rates-in-st-louis&#34;&gt;Mapping Crime Rates in St. Louis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense about whether crime appears high in Downtown St. Louis because it is one of the more densly populated areas of the city, I&amp;rsquo;ve mapped Part 1 crime &lt;em&gt;rates&lt;/em&gt; per 1,000 individuals. To get there, I divide the total number of crimes by the total number of esimtated people living in each neighborhood, and then multiply by 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rate_map_p1_cropped.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we factor in population density, we see that while Downtown remains a significant focal point for crime, there are areas both north and south of Downtown (as well as north of Forest Park) that also have high crime rates, but are not emphasized on the Belmar Proposal map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rate_map_v_cropped.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look only at violent crimes, the argument for focusing on Downtown goes away - our attention is drawn to North City as the locus for much of the violent crime in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bottom-line&#34;&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotspot that the Belmar proposal highlights is due to property crimes like larcency and motor vehicle theft, rather than violent crimes. At no point is there a significant volumne of crime in the Central West End, which was the other neighborhood highlighted in Belmar&amp;rsquo;s proposal. In fact, a good argument could be made that policing resources are most needed in the areas of the city no emphasized in the report at all.&lt;/p&gt;
